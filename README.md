To use it you should download chromedriver.exe from chrome and put it in the same folder with main.exe
If you face with not clicking wanted place issue you can try to change resolution of your browser
Also when the button clicked you should wait until it done with what it meant to do,and if app is freeze you should wait till its done what it meant to do.
If you wanna choose who you wanna follow only, u can delete every name in followers.txt file(if its not empty) and add all the users names u wanna keep following be sure to go new line after each follower

Have fun playing with it!




******This is my side project for myself to learn web automation, main goal is to let person only click a button and let the app handle everything for instagram 
for daily usage of it to make followers, if u download it you will see its so messy and somethings may be let you think it might be better with another algorithm
and if u let me know about that i would improve myself too, so please let me know if u see any improvement******
